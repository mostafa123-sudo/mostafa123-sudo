- 👋 Hi, I’m @mostafa  
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps, Cloud Computing, Backend Development, AI, and Machine Learning  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and working with:

  **🚀 DevOps Tools & Technologies**  
  - 🐳 Docker, 🐙 Kubernetes, 📦 Helm, 🏗️ OpenShift  
  - 🔁 CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI  
  - ☁️ Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, CloudWatch, Lambda), GCP, Azure  
  - ⚙️ Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation  
  - 🔐 Secrets Management: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager  
  - 🔧 Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Loki  
  - 🔒 Security: SonarQube, Trivy, Snyk  
  - 📦 Configuration Management: Ansible  
  - 📡 Messaging & Streaming: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ  
  - 🧪 Testing: JMeter, Postman  
  - 🧰 Container Registry: Docker Hub, AWS ECR  
  - 🌐 API Gateway, Load Balancers, NGINX, HAProxy  
  - 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS) and Shell Scripting  

  **💻 Backend Development**  
  - ☕ Java with Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring JPA  
  - 🐘 Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
  - 🔌 RESTful APIs, JWT Authentication, Email Notifications  
  - 🛠️ Tools: IntelliJ IDEA, Maven, Gradle, Postman  

  **🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
  - 🧠 TensorFlow, Keras (model development and training)  
  - 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
  - 👁️ Computer Vision (CV)  
  - 📊 Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas  
  - 📈 Model deployment & monitoring in production  
  - 🔬 Working on end-to-end ML pipelines (data preprocessing → training → evaluation → deployment)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:  
  - Java Spring Boot backend systems  
  - Scalable cloud-based architectures  
  - DevOps automation projects  
  - AI projects in NLP or CV (model development, training, and deployment)
